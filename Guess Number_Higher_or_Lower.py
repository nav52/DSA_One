Question

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
    -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
    1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
    0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
